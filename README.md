# Movie-Recommendation-System-Python-Flask-Web-Application-Heroku-Deployment


# STEPS
   1. Data Preprocessing
   2. Building Movie Recommender Machine Learning Model
    -->	To build our model, we first create a count matrix that is created by the help of a  		count vectorizer. We create a count vector with English stopwords &          fit and transform over the soup column we just created in the previous section. Scikit-learn has a very beautiful 	method called cosine similarity. It is simply a metric that is used to determine how 		similar documents are, irrespective of their size. After building the cosine similarity 	matrix for our dataset, we can now sort the results to find out the top 10 similar movies. 	   We return the movie title & indexes to the user.
   3. Creating Web Pages and connect it to Flask Rendering
   4. Create a complete interface and exception handling using python along with form validation
   5. Deploying to Herokuapp.com
